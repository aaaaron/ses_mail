ses_mail

Amazon Simple Email Service drop-in replacement for mail()

Find yourself having to switch someone elses project from using internal mail() function over to SES?  Is it on shared hosting where you can not implement the standard unix command line ses library as a sendmail clone?  Then maybe this will save you an hour of code.  

Depends on the ses.php library available here: http://www.orderingdisorder.com/aws/ses/
